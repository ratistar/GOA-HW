<!-- text formating tags (for example <b>, <i>, <u>) are used for visual presentations.
     They affect how the text looks but don't convey meaning about the text itself.
     temantic tags (for example:<header>, <article>, <footer>) provide meaning and context to the content.
        formatting tags focus on appearance, while semantic tags focus on meaning.-->
